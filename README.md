# Santander Bootcamp

During July of 2022, I studied some fullstack-related things in Digital Innovation One (DIO)'s platform. There were 5 modules, each divided in many classes; from git basics to frameworks, I'd say until now - I'm currently at module II - it has been pretty useful and I could learn a lot from the courses.
