# Santander Bootcamp

During July of 2022, I studied some fullstack-related things in Digital Innovation One (DIO)'s platform. There were 5 modules, each divided in many classes; from git basics to frameworks, I'd say until now - I'm currently at module III - it has been pretty useful and I could learn a lot from the courses.



## Module I: introduction content

### Courses

- Introduction to programming and computational thinking

- Introduction to Git and GitHub

### Description

The first course in this module is good for those who don't know much about programming, so it wasn't very helpful for me since I was at my third semester of computer science at uni, but the other one certainly gave me a really good basis when it comes to git; until then, I only committed manually on GitHub :grimacing:. 



## Module II: HTML/CSS/JS

### Courses

- Introduction to websites' making with HTML5 and CSS3
- Positioning elements using Flexbox in CSS
- Introduction to JavaScript
- Syntax and operators of JavaScript
- Variables and types in JavaScript
- Mastering functions in JavaScript
- Maps and sets in JavaScript
- Map, filter and reduce
- Debugging and error handling with JavaScript
- Fundamentals of Asynchronous JavaScript
- Object orientation with JavaScript
- Working with modules in JavaScript
- Managing D.O.M with JavaScript
- Introduction to TypeScript

### Description

Since I had studied HTML and CSS in order to develop [my website](https://laistie.github.io/) - you can check its repository on GitHub [here](https://github.com/laistie/laistie.github.io) -, I basically skipped the first course's videos. On the other hand, I payed much attention on the flexbox lectures, because even though I was familiar with it, I'd still go through some trouble when positioning flexboxes :worried:.

Following that, I've started studying JavaScript and was formally introduced to frameworks - one of the examples was Angular, which will be the main focus on module III. Also I've learned the concept of hoisting and begun to dig more into JavaScript stuff, such as anonymous functions, IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), callbacks - which isn't difficult, but I wish I had been introduced to earlier at uni, since it's pretty useful when it comes to handling things in C, my main programming language nowadays -, objects (same as structs in C), this (keyword that refer to an object) and arrow functions. Then I've learned about collections and array methods, which become pretty useful when working with multiple items, and was introduced to the concept of APIs (Application Programming Interface) that is frequently used in dev world.

Finally, after lots and lots of JavaScript, I moved to TypeScript and the main focus of the course were data structures (defining types, interfaces and working with them). Additionally, I had to do some practice exercises, which you can check [here](https://github.com/laistie/bootcamp/tree/main/javascript).



## Module III: Angular

### Courses

- Introduction to Angular 8
