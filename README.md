# Santander Bootcamp

During July of 2022, I studied some fullstack-related things in Digital Innovation One (DIO)'s platform. There were 5 modules, each divided in many classes; from git basics to frameworks, I'd say until now - I'm currently at module II - it has been pretty useful and I could learn a lot from the courses.



## Module I: introduction content

### Courses

- Introduction to programming and computational thinking

- Introduction to Git and GitHub

### Description

The first course in this module is good for those who don't know much about programming, so it wasn't very helpful for me since I was at my third semester of computer science at uni, but the other one certainly gave me a really good basis when it comes to git; until then, I only committed manually on github :grimacing:. 



## Module II: HTML/CSS/JS

### Courses

- Introduction to websites' making with HTML5 and CSS3
- Positioning elements using Flexbox in CSS

### Description

Since I had studied HTML and CSS in order to develop [my website](https://laistie.github.io/) - you can check its repository on GitHub [here](https://github.com/laistie/laistie.github.io) -, I basically skipped the first course's videos.

On the other hand, I payed much attention on the flexbox lectures, because even though I was familiar with it, I'd still go through some trouble when positioning flexboxes :worried:.
